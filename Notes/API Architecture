Nomenclature

Drivers: 
    Drivers are mplemented within kernel space. They are designed to abstract hardware specific 
    implementation details away from API Developers.

    Driver interfaces will initially be non-specified. until a point where enough use-cases have
    arisen to produce a usable list of API functions that would be required.
